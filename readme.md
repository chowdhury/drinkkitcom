Drinkkit
=========================================================================================
Drinkkit is a FourSquare/Gowalla "clone" written in Django (GeoDjango, to get specific).
It was written out of two needs/desires:

    1) The author wanted to learn more geolocation crap.
    2) The Stewart/Colbert Rallies in DC were largely pushed by the efforts of members from
        Reddit.com, and there'll no doubt be massive bar crawls going on. It'd be cool if there
        was an easier way for Redditors to get to know one another, so this is one solution.

It's optimized to run on just about *any* phone/device with an internet connection, and could
be expanded to work outside the DC metro area if someone wants to handle it.


Requires for Dev Work
=========================================================================================
Install GeoDjango (I leave this to you, as anything involving this is annoying)
Setup Postgres/PostGIS (see: annoying)
Sync and run this app


Documentation?
=========================================================================================
